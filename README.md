# Who we are 

Game Plus is a revolutionary Gaming and AI blockchain tailored specifically for the gaming industry. By leveraging locally hosted LLMs, and community driven fine-tuned AI, Game Plus empowers developers to create highly interactive and intelligent games. 
We will provide vital AI industry tools such as asset and dialog generation engine, developer SDK, AI training data accessibility, and gaming data analysis and optimization.
The protocol is designed to serve core gaming infrastructure needs and create a decentralized AI-powered content generation engine for gaming.
# Our Mission

Game Plus is pioneering the development of a decentralized AI protocol for the gaming industry. Our platform addresses the current gaps in existing protocols, driving innovation and growth in the on-chain gaming sector. By leveraging cutting-edge blockchain technology, we empower game developers to focus on creating immersive gaming experiences while we handle the complexities of decentralized Infrastructure and AI tools, incentivized data sharing, NFT asset management, wallet abstraction, and on-chain data analytics.
#Limitations of Current Gaming AI

## Lack of Asset Generation tools

Currently, there are no generative AI services that offer asset generation such as UVs and Mesh for Blender and Unity. Most generative AI are text or pictures, not focusing on real gaming assets such as 2D/3D illustration and models, animations, prototyping and automated bug testing. 
## Data Silo and Lack of User Data Protection

Current data from gaming and AI companies are centralized and hidden and users do not know where their data is going and what data is pulled from current AI tools. The fragmentation of data across various platforms leads to a lack of data sharing. This greatly impacts the quality and efficiency of AI models. 
## Large costs for Computing and Fine-Tuning

Currently LLM requires a large amount of computer power to run. By utilizing our own nodes along with decentralizing computing power from users, we are able to cut the cost of hosting our LLM while providing rewards to contributors.
## Privatization of Data and AI Tools

Currently there are very few Open-Source Data and AI tools. Most services go through the big three models, GPT, Deepmind, and Llmaa. While large companies are creating their own applications, smaller developers do not have the resources and knowledge to create their own proprietary tools.

# Our Solution


## AI Asset Generation Engine & Attribution Module
Game Plus will create industry collaborations from small indie studios and AAA developers to fund and create asset generation tools. We will integrate multiple AI models for asset generation such as textures, 3D models, animations,and game prototyping. Our attribution module analyzes AI interactions and user engagements, providing insights on how AI influences player experiences.
## Decentralized AI Training and Inference
We will significantly reduce the costs associated with AI by leveraging computing resources on our chain. We want to democratize access to AI capabilities, allowing smaller organizations and researchers to participate in our AI development without the need for upfront investments in hardware and infrastructure. By using data from gamers and game developers, we are able to fine-tune our AI models to benefit our community of loyal gamers.
## Data Access and Sharing Incentives
By using data from native gamers and game developers on our chain, we are able to target specific AI solution governed by all contributors in the ecosystem. We will have a blockchain-based self-sovereign identity (SSI) system that allows users to securely share specific identity information online in a sovereign manner. Furthermore, users can monetize their personal gaming data by granting controlled access.


# Chain Infrastructure 

## Module Layers
Game Plus will be a modular Blockchain which enhances scalability, flexibility, and efficiency by allowing each layer to be developed and upgraded independently. The Infrastructure Layer provides the foundational elements such as virtual machines and network nodes. Data Availability Layer ensures access to essential data, including LLM training data, and user identity modules. The Trust Layer establishes the security and integrity of the blockchain through consensus algorithms and finality services. The Execution Layer handles the actual processing of transactions, execution of smart contracts, and provides a gaming SDK and API for developers. We will also have an Incentive Layer for Governance and Proof mechanisms. At the top, the Application Layer encompasses the end-user applications, including decentralized applications (DApps), in-house and third-party games, and user interfaces.
